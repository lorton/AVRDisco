This is my first KivyMD app, and much of the code was borrowed from the sample App:
https://github.com/Ngonie-x/todo-application-kivymd

# Packaging for android
I have added the spec file you can use to package with buildozer. You can follow [this link](https://dev.to/ngonidzashe/how-to-use-google-colab-to-package-kivymd-applications-with-buildozer-46bl) on how to package applications using google colab, provided by aforementioned todo sample.
